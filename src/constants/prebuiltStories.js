    text: "Alright, snuggle up little ones, pull those blankets up nice and tight, and let me tell you about one of the most wonderful adventures ever — a story about two best friends, a big journey across faraway lands, and a family that learned something really, really important about love. Ready? Here we go.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the big, buzzing, beautiful city of London, there lived a girl named Simran. Now Simran was absolutely wonderful — she had the brightest smile you've ever seen, she loved to laugh, and she had this amazing way of making everything around her feel cozy and warm, kind of like your favorite blanket on a cold night. She lived with her papa, her mama, and her little sister, and their house was always full of yummy smells from the kitchen and music floating through the windows.\n\nSimran's papa, whose name was Baldev Singh, was a big, round, jolly man with an even bigger mustache — honestly, you could probably hang a small hat on that mustache, it was so magnificently bushy. He ran a little shop in London, but deep, deep in his heart, he missed his home in India more than anything in the whole world. He missed the fields of golden wheat, the sound of the rivers, the smell of the earth after rain. And so he had made a plan — he was going to send Simran back to India to be best friends forever with a boy named Kuljeet, whose family were old, old friends of his.\n\nNow Simran wasn't so sure about this plan. She had her own dreams, you see. She wanted to travel, to explore, to see the big wide world. But she also loved her papa with her whole heart, so she didn't want to make him sad.\n\nBefore she went to India though, her mama gave her the most wonderful gift — a whole month to travel across Europe with her school friends! Can you imagine? Trains and castles and chocolate shops and everything! Simran was SO excited she practically bounced off the ceiling.\n\nAnd that is where our story really begins.\n\nOn the very first day of the big European adventure, at a loud, crowded, wonderfully chaotic train station, Simran nearly missed her train. She was running — thump thump thump — bags bouncing everywhere, hair flying, breathing all fast — when she grabbed onto the door of the train just in time. And as she tumbled inside, she bumped right into a boy.\n\nHis name was Raj.\n\nNow Raj was also from London, also going on a big adventure across Europe, also on this exact same train, which was already pretty amazing if you think about it. Raj had a huge grin, a very loud laugh, and absolutely zero ability to be on time for anything, ever. He had somehow also nearly missed the train, which Simran thought was both ridiculous and a little bit hilarious.\n\nAt first, Simran and Raj were not friends at all. Raj was silly and loud and he told terrible jokes that he thought were absolutely brilliant. Simran was a little more quiet and serious and she rolled her eyes at him approximately forty seven times in the first hour alone.\n\nBut then, something funny happened. Guess what it was!\n\nThey got separated from the rest of the group! Just the two of them, in a beautiful little town somewhere in the middle of Europe, surrounded by cobblestone streets and flower boxes on every window. And they had to figure out how to catch up with everyone else, all by themselves. Oh my goodness.\n\nNow you might think that sounds scary, but it was actually the most fun either of them had ever had. They explored little bakeries and ate warm bread with jam. They climbed a tiny hill to watch the sunset turn the whole sky pink and orange. They got completely lost and then found themselves again by following the sound of a church bell. They talked and talked and talked — about their families, their dreams, their favorite foods, the things that made them happy and the things that made them a little sad.\n\nAnd somewhere between the jam bread and the church bell and the sunset, Raj and Simran became the very best of friends. Real, true, deep-down friends. The kind where you don't have to pretend to be anyone other than who you are. Isn't that just the loveliest thing?\n\nBy the time they caught up with the rest of the group and the trip was over and it was time to go home, they both felt like something had shifted. Like the whole world was a little brighter and a little bigger and a little more wonderful than it had been before.\n\nBut then — oh, then came the hard part.\n\nSimran went home and her papa told her it was time. Time to go to India. Time to meet Kuljeet and his family. Time to say goodbye to London for a while.\n\nSimran felt her heart go a little quiet. She thought about her new best friend Raj. She thought about their adventure. And she wished, very much, that things could be different.\n\nBut Raj — clever, grinning, wonderful Raj — had a plan.\n\nHe decided he was going to go to India too. Not in a sneaky way, not in a tricks-and-schemes way. He was going to go and do things the right way. He was going to meet Simran's family properly, make them like him, make them see that he was a good person, and then, with everyone's blessing, he would ask if he and Simran could stay best friends forever — the kind of best friends who build a whole life together.\n\nHis own papa — a wonderfully round and cheerful man who told even worse jokes than Raj, which is really saying something — gave him a big hug and told him to go do it right. Do it with honesty. Do it with respect. And Raj promised he would.\n\nSo off he went to India!\n\nNow, Kuljeet and his family were — how do I put this nicely — a little bit silly. Kuljeet himself was very tall and very proud and walked around like he was the most important person in any room he entered, puffing out his chest like a very self-satisfied pigeon. His friends were equally silly, bumbling around and tripping over things and arguing about nothing important. They were not bad people. They were just, you know. A bit much.\n\nRaj showed up in the village and made himself right at home. He helped in the fields. He cooked. He sang. He made everyone laugh. He was so genuinely warm and kind and helpful that Simran's mama — a sweet, perceptive woman who noticed everything — started to think that maybe, just maybe, this boy was something rather special.\n\nEven Simran's little cousins absolutely adored him immediately, which, as any parent will tell you, is usually a very good sign.\n\nBut Simran's papa, big-mustached Baldev Singh, was a trickier puzzle. He was stubborn, you see. Not because he was mean — not even a little bit — but because he had made a promise a long, long time ago to his old friend about their children, and Baldev Singh was a man who kept his promises. Even when keeping them was hard. Even when maybe, perhaps, the world had changed a little since that promise was made.\n\nRaj tried everything. He was helpful and honest and kind. He fixed things. He learned the old songs. He showed Baldev Singh, in a hundred little ways, that he was someone who could be trusted with the most precious thing in the world — a father's child.\n\nAnd slowly, like the sun coming up very gradually in the morning, Baldev Singh started to see it too.\n\nThere was a wonderful, warm evening when Raj sat with Baldev Singh under the stars and they just talked. Really talked. About home, and love, and what it means to be a good person. And Baldev Singh looked at this young man with his ridiculous grin and his good heart and he thought — ah. I see.\n\nNow, Kuljeet — the self-satisfied pigeon — did eventually figure out that something was going on, and he puffed up his chest and made a lot of noise about it, the way pigeons do. His friends bumbled around trying to look important and mostly just knocked things over. It was, frankly, more funny than anything else.\n\nBut in the end, none of that mattered. Because Baldev Singh made a decision.\n\nHe walked to where Simran was standing, her bag over her shoulder, the morning train ready to leave, Raj standing at the door of the train car. And Baldev Singh looked at his daughter — his wonderful, bright, good-hearted daughter — and he made the most important choice of his life.\n\nHe let her go.\n\nNot because he stopped loving her. But because he loved her SO much that he wanted her to be happy more than he wanted to keep her close. And sometimes, that is what love means. It means opening your hands and saying — go on then. Go be wonderful. Go be happy. I'll always be right here.\n\nSimran hugged her papa for a long, long moment. And then she laughed — that bright laugh of hers — and she ran to catch the train, and Raj reached out his hand, and off they went together into the great big beautiful world.\n\nAnd Baldev Singh stood there with his magnificent mustache and his full, full heart, and he smiled.\n\nAnd somewhere in London, both their families were already planning the most spectacular celebration anyone had ever seen, with mountains of food and colors everywhere and music that went on for days.\n\nAnd they were all, every single one of them, very very happy.\n\nNow then, my little ones. Close your eyes. Let your arms go heavy. Let your legs go sleepy and slow. Think about the people you love who are right nearby, keeping you warm and safe tonight. Think about the big adventures waiting for you — not yet, not now, but someday. And think about how the very best thing in the whole wide world is finding a true friend who sees exactly who you are and thinks — yes. You. You're the one I want to have adventures with.\n\nDrift off now, slowly, softly. The stars are out. Everything is safe. Everything is warm.\n\nGoodnight, little ones. Goodnight.",

    text: "Alright, snuggle up little ones, pull those blankets nice and tight, and let me tell you about two of the funniest, bravest, most wonderfully silly best friends who ever went on an adventure together. Are you comfortable? Good. Here we go.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a little village called Ramgarh, tucked between golden hills and swaying fields, there lived a kind old man named Thakur. Now Thakur was wise and gentle, with the most magnificent white moustache you have ever seen in your entire life. It was so big and so fluffy that little sparrows sometimes tried to make their nests in it. Can you imagine that?\n\nThakur loved his village more than anything in the whole world. But there was a problem. A big, silly, ridiculous problem. A man called Gabbar had been causing all sorts of nonsense in the area. Now before you get worried, I want you to know something very important — Gabbar was not actually scary at all. He was more like that one uncle who tries to be dramatic at family gatherings but everyone secretly finds a little bit funny. He had a very loud voice, wore a very dusty hat, and was absolutely terrible at making plans. His plans never, ever worked. Not even once. His own henchmen spent most of their time tripping over each other and bumping into trees.\n\nGabbar had a whole gang of very clumsy fellows who followed him around. They wore mismatched clothes, their shoes were always on the wrong feet, and whenever they tried to do something menacing, something ridiculous happened instead. One time, they tried to sneak into a town and three of them got stuck in the same doorway at the exact same time. They had to shuffle sideways like crabs to get out. Gabbar had to sit down and fan himself because he was so embarrassed.\n\nAnyway, Thakur thought very hard about what to do. And then he had a brilliant idea. He needed help. Not just any help. He needed the most clever, most adventurous, most wonderfully chaotic pair of friends he had ever known. Their names were Jai and Veeru.\n\nNow Jai and Veeru were best friends. Not just ordinary best friends — they were the kind of best friends who finished each other's sentences, shared their last biscuit, and would do absolutely anything for each other. They had grown up together, gotten into trouble together, and gotten out of trouble together, usually by being extremely clever and just a little bit cheeky.\n\nJai was the quiet, thoughtful one. He liked to sit and think carefully before doing anything, and he played the most beautiful harmonica you ever heard. When he played it in the evenings, even the cows stopped what they were doing and listened. Veeru, on the other hand, was loud and cheerful and talked so fast that sometimes words just tumbled out of his mouth like popcorn from a bag. He was brave and bouncy and always had a big goofy grin on his face. Together, they were absolutely unstoppable.\n\nSo Thakur sent word to Jai and Veeru, and the two friends arrived in Ramgarh on a very sunny afternoon. The whole village came out to look at them. Guess what happened next! Veeru got off his horse, took one big bow, and then promptly walked straight into a lamppost. Jai just shook his head and smiled. This was very normal.\n\nThe village of Ramgarh was the most wonderful place. There was a water tank where kids played, a funny little jail that the local constable named Ramlal ran with great enthusiasm but very little success, and the most amazing chai stall run by a woman named Basanti. Now Basanti was something special. She drove a horse-cart at approximately the speed of a rocket, could talk for forty-five minutes without stopping even to breathe, and was friends with absolutely everyone. She and Veeru immediately became the very best of friends, because they were exactly the same kind of wonderful, chaotic energy. They would talk and laugh and argue about the silliest things, like whether mangoes were better than guavas and which cloud looked most like a sleeping elephant. They were absolutely inseparable pals.\n\nJai, meanwhile, quietly became friends with a lovely young woman named Radha, who was gentle and kind. They would sit together in comfortable, peaceful quiet. Sometimes Jai would play his harmonica and Radha would smile, and that was enough. The best friendships are sometimes like that — you don't need a hundred words, just a kind presence and a warm tune floating through the evening air.\n\nThe village children absolutely adored Jai and Veeru. They would follow them everywhere like a little parade. Veeru taught them how to do handstands, though he could only hold his for about four seconds before toppling sideways. Jai taught them how to whistle. Thakur's grandchildren especially loved when Veeru would tell enormously exaggerated stories about his adventures, where he got taller and braver and more magnificent with every single sentence. The kids would giggle so much their tummies hurt.\n\nNow, Jai and Veeru had a very important job to do. They had to stop Gabbar's gang from bothering the village. But being clever fellows, they decided that the very best way to deal with a silly gang was to be even sillier — but in a smart way.\n\nThe first time Gabbar's henchmen came clomping into the village, Jai and Veeru were ready. Veeru had tied strings across the road at ankle height, and every single one of those henchmen tripped and landed in a heap, one on top of the other, like a very untidy pile of laundry. They were so tangled up that it took them an hour to sort out whose legs belonged to whom. They went back to Gabbar completely rumpled and hiccupping from embarrassment.\n\nGabbar stamped his foot and made a very dramatic speech, which is what he always did when things went wrong. His hat fell over his eyes in the middle of it. His henchmen tried very hard not to giggle.\n\nThe second time they tried, Jai had set up a very elaborate system of mirrors that made the village look like it had about forty Jais and forty Veerus in it. The henchmen got so confused running in circles after reflections that they eventually just sat down in the middle of a field, completely dizzy, and had a little rest. Some of them fell asleep there. The village farmers stepped over them very politely on their way to work in the morning.\n\nCan you believe that? Forty Jais and forty Veerus! Imagine!\n\nBut the very best plan happened when Basanti got involved. Now, you remember Basanti and her horse-cart? Well, Gabbar made the mistake of thinking he could use Basanti's cart to sneak his gang into the village. What he did not know was that Basanti's horse, whose name was Dhanno, was a very opinionated horse who only listened to Basanti. When anyone else tried to drive the cart, Dhanno would take them on the most spectacular, terrifying, bumpy, zigzagging ride you could possibly imagine — through puddles, under low branches, across muddy fields — until the passengers begged to get off. Gabbar's gang arrived back at their hideout soaking wet, covered in mud, wearing twigs in their hair, and with absolutely nothing to show for their adventure except a very deep respect for that horse.\n\nAfter all of this, even Gabbar himself had to admit that these two friends were simply too clever. And honestly? By this point, Gabbar was getting very tired of all the mud and the tripping and the embarrassment. One day, Jai sat down near Gabbar's hideout and played his harmonica, and the music was so peaceful and so beautiful that it drifted right up into the hills. Gabbar found himself tapping his dusty boot along to the tune. His henchmen were quietly humming. It turned out that all they had really wanted, all along, was for someone to notice them. Not to fear them. Just to see them.\n\nJai suggested — very gently, very kindly — that perhaps there were better things to do than stomp around causing nonsense. Veeru, never one to miss an opportunity, immediately suggested they could all learn to do handstands together. And somehow, in the most unexpected way, that became the beginning of a very different chapter for Gabbar and his gang. They stayed out of the village's way, and eventually some of them even helped with the harvest, though they were not very good at it and dropped a lot of things.\n\nThe village of Ramgarh had the most wonderful celebration you could imagine. There was dancing and music and so much food that even the birds flying overhead got a little full just from smelling it. Thakur smiled under his magnificent moustache. Basanti danced and talked at the same time, which is very hard to do. Radha laughed more than she had in a long, long time. And Jai and Veeru stood together watching it all, their arms around each other's shoulders, the best of friends in the whole wide world.\n\nAnd that night, when the stars came out over the golden hills of Ramgarh, Jai played one last song on his harmonica, soft and slow and sweet, and it floated out over the rooftops and into the warm dark sky.\n\nThe village went to sleep. The horses went to sleep. Even the very embarrassed, very reformed henchmen went to sleep, a little cleaner and a little happier than before.\n\nAnd now, my darling ones, it is time for you to go to sleep too. Let the music of Ramgarh drift into your dreams tonight. Maybe you'll dream of golden hills, and good friends, and a big fluffy moustache, and somewhere out there, a horse named Dhanno trotting happily through the moonlight.\n\nClose your eyes now. You're safe and cozy and loved.\n\nGoodnight, little ones. Goodnight.",

    text: "Alright, snuggle up little ones, pull those blankets nice and tight, and let me tell you about three of the most wonderfully silly, incredibly smart, and deeply wonderful friends who ever walked the halls of a very serious, very stuffy school called Imperial College of Engineering. Ready? Here we go.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a boy named Rancho. Now Rancho was not your ordinary boy. He had the brightest, sparkliest eyes you ever saw, and when he looked at something — anything, even a broken toaster or a leaky tap — his brain would just start buzzing and whirring like a little engine going full speed. He didn't just learn things, he understood them, right down in his heart. And that made him very, very special.\n\nRancho got into this big, grand, enormously intimidating college, and on his very first day, he met two boys who would become his best friends in the whole entire world.\n\nThe first was Farhan. Farhan had the funniest, most expressive face you could imagine — his eyebrows did little dances when he was surprised, and when he laughed, his whole body shook like a washing machine on spin cycle. Can you believe that? He actually wanted to be a wildlife photographer more than anything in the world, but his papa had decided he would be an engineer. So there poor Farhan was, studying circuits instead of photographing elephants.\n\nThe second friend was Raju. Oh, sweet, nervous Raju. Raju worried about everything. He worried about exams. He worried about his family. He worried about worrying too much. He wore a little charm around his neck and prayed so hard before every test that his hands would shake like leaves in the wind. But underneath all that worrying was the kindest, most loyal heart you ever found.\n\nAnd together, these three boys — Rancho, Farhan, and Raju — became the most magnificent trio the college had ever seen. They called themselves the three idiots, which sounds like an insult but was actually their most treasured, giggliest little secret joke between friends.\n\nNow the college had a director. His name was Viru Sahastrabuddhe, but everyone — and I mean absolutely everyone — called him Virus behind his back. Can you picture him? He was a tall, stiff man who walked like a ruler had been sewn inside his shirt, perfectly straight, perfectly rigid, never ever bending. He had a magnificent moustache that seemed to have its own personality, bristling and twitching whenever he was cross, which was almost always. Virus believed that life was one enormous race, and everyone had to run it as fast as possible without stopping to smell a single flower or ask a single interesting question. His favourite thing to say, in his most booming, important voice, was that life is a race, and if you don't run fast, you'll get trampled!\n\nRancho thought that was the silliest thing he had ever heard. And Rancho had a magical, marvellous way of saying so.\n\nIn class one day, when a very pompous professor was going on and on about complicated definitions in the most complicated, jawbreaking words, Rancho simply raised his hand and said, excuse me sir, but why can't we just say it simply? And then he explained the whole thing in the most beautiful, easy, lovely way, and the whole class sat there with their mouths open like little fish. The professor's face turned approximately seventeen shades of red. It was absolutely magnificent.\n\nVirus, of course, did not think it was magnificent. He squinted his eyes and puffed up his moustache and decided that this Rancho was going to be trouble. He had a favourite student named Chatur, who was also known as Silencer, because — well — let's just say he had some very unfortunate digestive habits and leave it at that, shall we? Chatur memorised every single word in every single book, even words he didn't understand, and he could recite them at tremendous speed like a little talking machine. Chatur wanted very badly to beat Rancho at everything. He practiced his speeches in the mirror. He highlighted his textbooks in four different colours. He laughed a very strange laugh that sounded like a hiccupping goat. Heh heh heh, just like that.\n\nGuess what happened next! Chatur was chosen to give a big, important speech at the college's grand ceremony, in front of everyone — parents, professors, and all. He had memorised every single word. He practiced a hundred times. He was absolutely certain he was going to be the most impressive person in the room.\n\nBut Rancho, with that twinkly mischief in his eyes, quietly swapped some of the words in Chatur's speech with very silly words. And so there stood Chatur, in his finest clothes, saying the most gloriously ridiculous things in front of the entire gathering, with complete confidence, not understanding a single word he was saying. The audience gasped. Professors choked on their tea. And somewhere in the back, Farhan, Rancho, and Raju were laughing so hard they had to hold each other up. Oh, it was something.\n\nBut the story isn't just about pranks and giggles, little ones. It gets a bit more meaningful now, so keep those eyes open just a little longer, okay?\n\nFarhan was growing sadder and sadder because he was studying something he didn't love. He had boxes and boxes of wildlife photographs under his bed, letters to his favourite photographer that he was too scared to send, a whole dream tucked away like a secret. And Raju was so frightened of failing his family that the fear had wrapped itself around him like a heavy, heavy blanket.\n\nRancho looked at his two best friends and he said something that I want you to remember, my darlings, because it is one of the truest things anyone ever said. He said, follow excellence, and success will chase you. Do what you love with your whole heart, and everything else will find its way.\n\nNow there came a very dramatic, very stormy night. There was a big flood of rain, and someone needed help in an emergency, and all those fancy machines and equipment in the college weren't working properly. And what did Rancho do? He looked around at ordinary things — bits and pieces, simple tools — and with that wonderful buzzing brain of his, he figured out a solution that none of the professors with all their degrees had thought of. He saved the day not with memorised facts, but with real, genuine understanding. Virus stood there afterwards, his moustache very still for the first time, and something shifted in those stern eyes of his. Just a little.\n\nFarhan finally, finally sent his letter to the famous wildlife photographer he admired. And the photographer wrote back! He said he loved Farhan's work and wanted to meet him. When Farhan told his papa, he was shaking all over. But his papa, who loved his son even more than he loved his own ideas about what his son should be, hugged him and said yes. Yes, go and follow your dream. And Farhan cried the happiest tears you ever saw.\n\nRaju learned, slowly and surely, that worrying about the future was keeping him from living in the present. He stopped shaking quite so much. He started answering questions not because he was afraid of getting them wrong, but because he was genuinely curious about getting them right. And that made all the difference in the world.\n\nAs for Chatur, he went off convinced he had won some great competition, puffed up with pride, muttering about how he would be the most successful person from the college. And maybe he did get a very big, very impressive job with a very long, very boring title. But he never quite understood why Rancho's eyes always sparkled and his never did.\n\nAnd Rancho? Well, our dear wonderful Rancho had a whole adventure of his own, a journey that took him far away to a quiet, beautiful place in the mountains where he kept on inventing and creating and learning, just for the pure joy of it. He became someone who held hundreds of patents, which means he had invented hundreds of clever, useful, brilliant things. Not because he wanted to win any race. Just because he loved it.\n\nYears later, Farhan and Raju went on a grand road trip to find their old friend, and when they finally found him — oh, my goodness — it was the most joyful, laughter-filled reunion you can possibly imagine. They hugged and talked and laughed until the mountains echoed with it. Three idiots, together again. The very best kind of idiots there are.\n\nAnd so, my sleepy little loves, here is what our three friends want you to know as you drift off to dream tonight.\n\nYou don't have to be the fastest runner in any race. You don't have to memorise things you don't understand. You don't have to be scared of getting things wrong, because getting things wrong is just how you find out how to get them right.\n\nFind the thing that makes your brain buzz and your heart sing, just like Rancho did. Be brave enough to say so out loud, just like Farhan did. And let go of worry just enough to take the next small step, just like Raju did.\n\nAnd always, always keep your friends close. The ones who laugh with you and believe in you and stay up too late with you talking about all the things you love. Those friends are worth more than any trophy or certificate or gold star.\n\nNow close those beautiful eyes, little one. The stars are out, the world is quiet, and tomorrow is waiting with all its wonderful, curious, magnificent possibilities.\n\nSleep well, my darling. Sweet, sweet dreams.",

    text: "Alright, snuggle up little ones, pull those blankets nice and tight, and let me tell you a wonderful story about friendship, and feelings, and a little bit of magic that happens when people truly care about each other. Ready? Here we go.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a big, beautiful college called St. Xavier's, there were two very best friends in the whole wide world. Their names were Rahul and Anjali. Now, these two were absolutely inseparable. Like peanut butter and jam. Like stars and the night sky. Like you and your favourite stuffed animal that you absolutely cannot sleep without. They did everything together — they played basketball, they got into silly little bits of mischief, they laughed so loud that teachers would poke their heads out of classrooms just to see what all the noise was about.\n\nRahul was the kind of boy who was funny and charming and always had the biggest smile in any room. And Anjali, oh Anjali was something else entirely. She was loud and wonderful and brave, and she wore her hair in these two little braids and ran around in her tracksuit like she owned the whole basketball court. And honestly? She kind of did.\n\nNow, these two friends had the most magical friendship you could imagine. Until one day, a new girl arrived at the college. Her name was Tina. And Tina was very pretty and very kind, and she wore lovely clothes and spoke in this soft, gentle way that made everyone turn and look. Can you imagine being the new kid like that? A little bit terrifying, honestly.\n\nWell, Rahul and Tina became very good friends very quickly. They liked the same songs, they laughed at the same jokes, and before long, Rahul was spending more and more time with Tina. And poor Anjali, well, she started to feel a little bit left out. A little bit forgotten. You know that feeling when your best friend starts playing with someone else at recess and you're standing there not quite knowing what to do with your hands? Yes, that feeling. That's exactly what Anjali felt.\n\nAnd because Anjali had such a big, big heart, and because she didn't quite know how to say \"hey, I miss you, I feel a bit sad,\" she decided the bravest thing she could do was step back. She quietly packed up her heart, kept her chin up, and eventually she left the college and moved far away. And Rahul, who was so wrapped up in his new friendship with Tina, didn't quite realise until it was too late just how much he missed his very best friend in the whole world.\n\nNow here's where the story gets really interesting, so don't you dare fall asleep just yet.\n\nRahul and Tina grew up, and they had a tiny little baby girl. They named her Anjali. Isn't that sweet? He named her after his old best friend, because even after all those years, he never quite forgot her. But very sadly, Tina became very ill, and she passed away when little Anjali was just a baby. Before she went, though, Tina did something absolutely extraordinary. She wrote her daughter eight letters. One for every birthday, so that even when she wasn't there, her love would still find little Anjali every single year. Isn't that one of the most beautiful things you've ever heard?\n\nSo little Anjali grew up with her papa Rahul and her dadi, which means grandma, who was the most wonderfully dramatic grandma you have ever seen in your life. Dadi wore big sparkly saris and had very strong opinions about everything and she was absolutely hilarious. She once dramatically fainted onto a velvet sofa just because someone served her the wrong kind of tea. Just imagine that. A full, theatrical swoon. Over tea.\n\nNow, when little Anjali turned eight years old, she opened her eighth letter from her mama Tina. And in that letter, Tina had written something magical. She told her daughter that her papa, Rahul, needed a best friend again. She said that somewhere out there was a woman named Anjali, the original Anjali, who had once been his very dearest friend, and that little Anjali should go and find her. Because her papa deserved to have that kind of friendship and happiness again.\n\nCan you believe that? A letter from a mama who loved her family so much that she was still looking after them even from far, far away.\n\nSo little Anjali, who was brave and determined and absolutely her father's daughter in the very best way, decided she was going to find the original Anjali. She was going to find her papa's long lost best friend if it was the last thing she did.\n\nWith the help of her wonderful, wonderfully nosy grandma dadi, who was thrilled about this whole adventure because it meant she got to be dramatic about something, little Anjali tracked down the original Anjali. And guess what? Grown up Anjali was working as a camp counsellor at a lovely summer camp in Shimla, up in the beautiful mountains where everything smells like pine trees and cold fresh air.\n\nLittle Anjali packed her bags, went to the camp, and there she met the original Anjali, who was now a tall, beautiful, wonderful woman. And the moment little Anjali saw her, she just knew. You know how sometimes you meet someone and it feels like you've known them forever? Just like that.\n\nBut wait. Guess what happened next. There was a small, slightly silly problem.\n\nGrown up Anjali was almost engaged to a man named Aman. Now Aman was a very nice fellow, very cheerful, very enthusiastic, always smiling an enormous smile that took up most of his face. He meant very well. But here's the thing about Aman — he was a tiny bit clumsy and a little bit goofy, and whenever he tried to be impressive he would somehow end up tripping over something or saying exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong moment. He once tried to make a grand romantic gesture with a bunch of balloons and accidentally let them all go at once so they floated away into the sky. He just stood there watching them drift off with this baffled expression. Very sweet man, very disaster-prone.\n\nLittle Anjali liked Aman, she really did. But she had a mission. She wanted her papa and her best friend, grown up Anjali, to find each other again. She wrote to her papa. She sent him messages. She told him where she was. She practically drew him a map with a big shiny star on it that said \"come here immediately, papa.\"\n\nAnd Rahul came.\n\nAnd the moment Rahul and Anjali saw each other again after all those years, it was like watching two puzzle pieces click back into place. All those years of missing each other, all those quiet moments of wondering whatever happened to that best friend, all of that just sort of melted away. They laughed together like no time had passed at all. They remembered all their old silly jokes. They finished each other's sentences. They played basketball again, and Anjali was still absolutely brilliant at it, by the way.\n\nNow, Aman, bless his heart, could see what was happening. He could see that these two people had a friendship so deep and so real that it had survived years and years of being apart. And even though he was a little bit sad, because he really did care about Anjali, Aman was also a genuinely good person. He pulled Anjali aside one day, gave her his biggest, goofiest grin, and said, in his cheerful bumbling way, that he just wanted her to be happy. And then he tripped over a garden hose on the way out, which was very him, and everyone laughed including him, which was also very him.\n\nAnd so, with Aman's kind blessing, and with little Anjali jumping up and down and cheering so enthusiastically she nearly fell into the fountain, Rahul and Anjali promised each other they would never lose touch again. That they would always be there for each other. That friendship, real true friendship, is one of the most precious things in the whole wide world and you should hold onto it with both hands.\n\nDadi, when she heard the news, dramatically collapsed onto a chair with her hand on her heart and declared it was the happiest day of her entire magnificent life. Then she asked if there was cake. There was cake. Everything was wonderful.\n\nAnd little Anjali, that brave, determined, extraordinary little girl who had carried her mama's letter in her heart and set off on the most important mission in the world, she curled up that night in her camp bed and looked up at the stars through the window. And she whispered goodnight to her mama, somewhere up there among them, and she said thank you. Because somehow, because of love that never really goes away, her family was whole and happy and full of laughter again.\n\nAnd somewhere, floating gently through the night sky, Aman's balloons were still drifting along having a perfectly lovely time.\n\nNow then, little ones. Your eyes are getting heavy, aren't they? That's alright. Let your eyelids flutter closed. Think about the people you love most, the friends who make you laugh, the family who holds you close. That love is always there, even when it's quiet, even when people are far away. It never really leaves.\n\nJust like the stars.\n\nJust like a letter written with all the love in the world.\n\nSweet dreams, my darlings. Sleep tight now. I love you so very much.",

    text: "Alright, snuggle up little ones, pull those blankets up nice and cozy, and let me tell you a wonderful story about a little village, a very silly man, and the most exciting cricket match that ever, ever happened in the whole wide world. Ready? Here we go.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a beautiful village called Champaner, tucked away in the sunny hills of India, there lived a cheerful young man named Bhuvan. Bhuvan had the biggest smile you ever saw, hair that was always a little messy, and a heart so full of courage it could barely fit in his chest. He loved his village more than anything. He loved the people, the little houses, the dusty fields, and even the stubborn old ox who refused to walk in a straight line.\n\nNow, the village of Champaner had a little problem. Well, actually a rather big problem. There was a man called Captain Russell who lived in a fancy fort nearby and thought he was terribly, terribly important. Captain Russell wore a stiff uniform, had a moustache that curled up at the ends like two little snails, and he walked around with his nose so high in the air that he probably couldn't even see his own boots. Can you believe that?\n\nCaptain Russell had decided that the villagers had to pay something called lagaan. Lagaan was like a big pile of grain that the villagers had to hand over every single year. And that year, because the rains hadn't come and the crops were sad and droopy, the villagers were having an enormously hard time. Bhuvan went to the Captain and very politely said, please sir, could we perhaps not pay the lagaan this year? Our tummies are rather empty already.\n\nAnd do you know what Captain Russell did? He twirled his silly moustache, puffed up his chest like a big pompous pigeon, and said no. Not only no, but he said the villagers would have to pay DOUBLE the lagaan. Double! Oh, he was so very pleased with himself about that. He even did a little self-satisfied chuckle. He was not a very nice man, but he was also not a very smart one, which is important to remember.\n\nBut then, oh but then, Captain Russell had another idea. He pointed out to the cricket field behind his fort and he said, I'll tell you what. My soldiers and I will play a cricket match against your little village. If you win, nobody in the whole region pays any lagaan for three whole years. Three whole years! But if you lose, you pay three times the lagaan. Three times!\n\nThe whole village gasped. The old men shook their heads. The aunties looked worried. Nobody in Champaner had ever even played cricket before. They didn't even know what cricket was! It was a game the British soldiers played with a bat and a ball, and it looked very confusing and very difficult.\n\nEveryone told Bhuvan, no no no, don't agree to this, it's a terrible idea. But Bhuvan looked at his village, looked at his friends, looked at the sad hungry faces around him, and he thought, we can do this. We just have to learn. And so, with the biggest grin on his face, he shook Captain Russell's hand and said yes.\n\nGuess what happened next! Captain Russell went back to his fort laughing and laughing, because he thought it was the funniest thing in the world that a bunch of farmers wanted to play cricket against his trained soldiers. His assistant kept nervously adjusting his hat. His soldiers slapped each other on the back. Oh, they thought they had already won.\n\nBut Bhuvan got to work straight away.\n\nFirst he needed a team. Now gathering a team was not the easiest thing, because the people of Champaner were all quite different. There was Deva, who was tall and strong and could throw anything very very far. There was Guran, who was a little clumsy but absolutely full of enthusiasm, and every time he tried to catch the ball he would spin around twice and fall over, but he kept getting right back up with a big laugh. There was a man called Bagha who never said much but had the most extraordinary aim you have ever seen. There was Lakha, who was a bit of a grumbler and whose eyebrows always seemed to be in a bad mood, but he could run quite fast when he wanted to.\n\nAnd then, in a lovely twist, there was a girl called Gauri, Bhuvan's best friend from childhood, who was absolutely the most enthusiastic supporter the team had ever had. She cheered so loudly at every single practice that the birds flew off the trees in surprise. She brought everyone water and snacks and made sure nobody gave up when things got hard. She was the heart of the whole team, really.\n\nAnd here is something rather wonderful. Captain Russell had a sister called Elizabeth, who had come to visit. Now Elizabeth was nothing like her brother. She was kind and gentle and she thought her brother's moustache was honestly a bit ridiculous too. When she saw how hard the villagers were working and how much they cared about their home, she wanted to help. She became a great friend to Bhuvan and the team, and she taught them the rules of cricket, drawing little diagrams in the dirt and explaining things very patiently while Guran kept asking the same question over and over again and she answered it every single time with a smile.\n\nSo the team practiced and practiced and practiced. They practiced in the morning when the sun was just waking up. They practiced in the evening when the fireflies came out. There were days when the ball went completely the wrong way and bonked someone on the head and everyone would dissolve into giggles. There were days when they felt tired and wondered if it was all too hard. But then Bhuvan would do that big bright smile of his and say, come on, one more time, and they would all pick themselves up and try again.\n\nCaptain Russell, meanwhile, was absolutely not worried. He was too busy admiring himself in the mirror and telling his soldiers how brilliant they were. His soldiers were actually quite good at cricket, which made things tricky. But you know what? The villagers had something the soldiers didn't have. They were playing for their home. They were playing for their families. They were playing for every hungry tummy and every tired face in Champaner, and that made them brave in a way that's very hard to practice.\n\nFinally, the great big day arrived. Oh, the match was three whole days long! All the villagers came and sat in the sunshine. Some brought little flags. Some brought snacks. The aunties had made enormous amounts of food. There was cheering and gasping and holding of breath.\n\nThe soldiers batted first and they were very good indeed, and for a while it looked quite scary, except nobody was actually scared because Guran kept doing his funny little stumble every time he got excited and it was very hard to feel scared when Guran was around.\n\nThen it was Champaner's turn. And oh, there were some brilliant moments and some heart-in-your-mouth moments. At one point Bhuvan hit the ball so hard it went sailing through the air like a little comet and everyone screamed with joy. At another point the whole team huddled together and Bhuvan said, we've got this, and you could feel the love they all had for each other just shimmering in the air.\n\nCaptain Russell kept making faces from the sidelines. His moustache twitched with irritation. He tried all his cleverest tricks. His best bowler bowled the trickiest balls. But the villagers had practiced so very hard and they knew each other so well and they trusted each other completely.\n\nAnd then, on the very last ball of the very last day, with the whole crowd holding their breath so tightly that not a single person was breathing, Bhuvan stood there with his bat, and he looked at the ball coming toward him, and he swung with everything he had, and CRACK, off it went, soaring up into the blue sky, and it landed way, way out beyond the field, and everyone erupted. Jumping, hugging, crying, laughing, spinning around in circles. Even the grumpy-eyebrowed Lakha had tears running down his face. Guran fell over twice from sheer happiness.\n\nChampaner had won.\n\nCaptain Russell stood there with his mouth hanging open like a fish, and his moustache drooped, and his assistant had to remind him to close his mouth. Then Captain Russell had to do the most difficult thing he had ever done in his very pompous life. He had to admit that the village had won, fair and square. He looked as though he had swallowed something sour. Then he turned around and marched back to his fort, and his snail-curl moustache never looked quite so confident again.\n\nAnd for three whole years, not a single person in the whole region had to pay any lagaan. The rains came back, the crops grew tall and golden, and the village of Champaner was happy and full and grateful. They told the story of that cricket match to their children, and their children told it to their children, and it became the most wonderful legend of the most wonderful village that ever there was.\n\nSo you see, little ones, it doesn't matter if something seems impossible or too hard or too big. If you have good friends beside you, and you're brave enough to try, and you get back up every single time you fall down, just like Guran always did, then anything, anything at all, can happen.\n\nNow close your eyes, my darlings. Let the warm feeling of that big cheering crowd carry you off to sleep. Dream of sunny fields and good friends and the sound of a cricket bat going crack against a ball and sailing up, up, up into the big beautiful sky.\n\nGoodnight, little ones. Goodnight.",
